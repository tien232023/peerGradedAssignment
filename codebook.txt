The codebook for "final_desired_data.txt"
=========================================
[Where the data was from ?]
The data was derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"). As described in the README file provided by the authors of that dataset, they performed an experiment consisting of 30 volunteers, each wearing a sensor capable of detecting motion signals in six conditions, such as walking, standing and etc. The sampling rate of the sensor was 50Hz, meaning that 50 signals (something numeric) kept being generated per second. The reading window was 2.56 secs, meaning that every observation was actually the set of all the signals occurring in 2.56 secs. Thus, every observation was a vector consisting of 2.56 x 50 = 128 elements. After some pre-processing, the vector was then used to derive various feature variables, such as "tBodyAcc-mean()", and there were 561 of them, their name stored in "features.txt" and their value in "X_train.txt".
=========================================
[Variable information]
The "subject" variable in the data was read from "y_train.txt", indicating the ID of the person for that observation. The "activity" variable indicated the condition in which the signals and features were produced. For example, the first row, starting with "1" and "WALKING", corresponded to the features of the person (ID 1) in walking. The rest of variables were the average of the original ones. (For example, there were 95 observations produced for "1" and "WALKING", all with different features in different rows, and I have averaged them variable-specifically into one row for "1" and "WALKING")
